# Case Files

The dxf filenames for the Terrazzo case all have the following format:

` [designator] - [description] - [number]x.dxf`

**designator** is a letter or number that indicates stacking order. Letters indicate foot parts with a being the top and c being the bottom. Numbers indicate main case parts which stack from 0 on the bottom up to 5 on top.

**description** is a short summary of the function a particular piece serves.

**number** tells you how many copies of that particular part are needed for the case (i.e. 2x means make 2 of that part).
